Build-A-Game Club Repo

Welcome to the Build-A-Game Club repo! Just ask James to add you as a collaborator to the project.

To join Github, go to the following link and register: https://github.com/join

We will begin collaborating a few weeks after initial Unity training.

Current ideas for our video game are as follows:
 - Zombie survival game
 - A game that includes Guangzhou/ourselves as characters
 - 2D or 3D?
 - If 3D, first person or third person?
 
Remember that depending on our club size, we may also divide the club into multiple game teams as well.

For example, if we have a game called GZBlaster2018, but someone starts building an RPG called Under Heaven,
we can divide into 2 large teams to make it work. Let's try not to do this too much though, as it will decrease
the number of people we have per team.

For each game we attempt, we will likely have 5-6 work groups:

- Story Team: It's your job to brainstorm for the game's concept and also write the characters/world setting, as well as
the game's plot and overall concept.
- Design Team: It's your job to find or build the assets that get used in the game world, including 
things like trees (environment objects), the terrain (the environment itself), the sky (environment),
and the characters that populate the game. You will also handle the graphics and animations required.
- UI (User Interface) Team: It's your job to create the user interface, including the welcome screen, menus, and in-game
interface used to play.
- Engine Team: It's your job to script gameplay and make assets actually do what they need to in-game. Your job is to
coordinate with the other teams and make the game function properly.

Note that you may belong to more than one team, and everyone may have input into the creative process.

Enter the Game: It may be possible to add 3D models of real-world objects, including ourselves, to our Unity project
using a Microsoft Kinect to scan. If anyone has this device, please let me know. I'll also be buying one soon.
